#summary The HomeOffice project is being used to document an AppFuse quickstart. The code is also used as a testbed for an example application used in a book called AppFuse Primer.

= Introduction =

The goal is to create a useable web application that is structured like AppFuse and uses
Maven to handle the software process.

= Details =

The first codebase was setup using the modular concept like AppFuse version 2.x not released  as of December 27, 2006.  I created a new project using appfuse-archetype-basic and this is now the HomeOffice project.  I changed the style to andreas01 and also changed some CSS specifics that I've been working on.  A new banner image was created and added to the andreas01 style folder.
