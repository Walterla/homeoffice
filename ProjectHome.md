This project is an example of the use of AppFuse.  I want to create a popular application that others will help with that is useful to many people.  A web application that can be hosted inside a home can be used by each of the household members and parents can have administrative rights, where children can use the application but not with administrative rights. The project is also being used as a testbed for an example code to support a book from SourceBeat publishing called AppFuse Primer.
